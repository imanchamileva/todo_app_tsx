# This project will be a ToDo App based on the Atomic Design 


# What is Atomic Design ?
Popularly known within the design world, Atomic Design helps to build consistent, solid and reusable design systems.

=> Atoms : Atoms are the smallest possible components, such as buttons, titles, inputs or event color pallets, animations, and fonts.

=> Molecules : They are the composition of one or more components of atoms. Here we begin to compose complex components and reuse some of those components.

=> Organisms : Organisms are the combination of molecules that work together or even with atoms that compose more elaborate interfaces. 

=> Templates : In this state we stop composing components and begin to set their context.

=> Pages : Pages are the navigate parts of the application and itâ€™s where the components are distributed in one specific template.
